## Using ramdisk for Docker storage
This example shows how to use ramdisk for Docker storage. The intention of using ramdisk is to see if we have a performance gain for docker export/load and docker IO peformance in general.

### Note
This example is still under experiment and we do not know if we can improve Docker IO performance.
