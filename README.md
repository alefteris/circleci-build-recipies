### Caching with Docker Hub
This branch demonstrates how we can use Docker Hub to cache docker images on CircleCI.

What we are doing here is very simple:

- Pull image from Docker Hub that was pushed from previous builds
- Build image from Docker file
- Push the image back to Docker Hub for the next build
